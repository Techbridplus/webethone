## Pull request and code review guidlines

Write Small PRs: Aim to create small, focused pull requests that fulfill a single purpose. Smaller pull requests are easier and faster to review and merge.<br/>
Review Your Own PR First: Review, build, and test your pull request before submitting it to catch errors or typos early.<br/>
Provide Context and Guidance: Write clear titles and descriptions for your pull requests, including the purpose, an overview of changes, and links to any related issues or conversations.
